The present work demonstrated that this process was one of the most effective and simple methods for the preparation of dense bulk Ti3SiC2 materials. Lattice constants of a=3.068 and c=17.645 are calculated for Ti3SiC2 made through this process. The synthesis temperature influenced the phase composition, microstructure and mechanical properties of Ti3SiC2 prepared at different temperatures. And bulk materials with flexural strength of 480 MPa and fracture toughness of 7.88 MPa.m1/2 were obtained at 1600°C.

The raw materials used in this process are Ti, Si, and graphite powders. Fluctuation synthesis utilized Si as in-situ liquid forming phase (additive), which was formed by heating the powder mixtures to 1300°C and using the heat released from the exothermic reaction for Ti3SiC2 formation. The result demonstrated that the reaction time for the formation of Ti3SiC2 was dramatically shortened using fluctuation method and the powders produced using this method contained more than twice amount of Ti3SiC2 compared to the solid reaction synthesized powders. The powders prepared by fluctuation method are fiber-like in morphology with dimensions of 0.8–2 ?m in width and 5–10 ?m in length. The growth direction of the fiber-like Ti3SiC2 particulate is {101 – 1}*. The lattice parameters for Ti3SiC2 were determined by a trial-and-error method and are a=3.067 ? and c=17.645 ?."

In this work, the microstructure and damage tolerance mechanism of Ti3SiC2 was investigated. The result demonstrated that the Ti3SiC2 ceramics prepared by the in-situ hot pressing/solid-liquid reaction process had a dual microstructure, i.e., large laminated grains were distributed within small equiaxial grains. This microstructure is analogous to that of platelets reinforced ceramic matrix composites. The bending test using single-edge-notched-beam specimens revealed that Ti3SiC2 was a damage tolerance material. The damage tolerance mechanisms for Ti3SiC2 are basal plane slip, grain buckling, crack deflection, crack branching, pull-out and delamination of the laminated grains."

At filer content of less than 20 vol%, the electrical conductivity for Cu/Ti3SiC2 composites was higher than that for Cu/graphite composites; at high filer content, the electrical conductivity for Cu/Ti3SiC2 composites was lower than that for Cu/graphite composites because of the presence of residual pores.

Polycrystalline Ti3SiC2 exhibited positive temperature dependence of flow stress (flow stress anomaly) and showed a temperature peak at 1173 K. The brittle-to-ductile transition temperature (BDTT) for polycrystalline Ti3SiC2 was strainrate sensitive, an approximately 100 K decrease in transition temperature was associated with four times of magnitude decrease in strain rate. In addition, the fracture morphology changed from predominately intergranular to mostly transgranular. The mechanism responsible for the brittle-to-ductile transition in Ti3SiC2 was involved in the onset of a thermally activated deformation process."

SYNTHESIS OF Ti3SiC2 POWDERS BY A SOLID-LIQUID REACTION PROCESS,Sun Zhimei,Zhang Yi,-,"Sun Zhimei,Zhang Yi,Zhou Yanchun",Scripta Materialia,Q2,4.539,41,1,61-66,1999,Elsevier Ltd,https://doi.org/10.1016/S1359-6462(99)00054-8,1999scripta-sun_scripta_1999.pdf,1999scripta-sun_scripta_1999.jpg,"Ti3SiC2 is a novel ceramic material, which combines the merit of both metals and ceramics. Like metals it is thermal and electrical conductive, easy to machine with conventional tools, and resistant to thermal shock; like ceramics it has high strength, high melting point and thermal stability (1). Ti3SiC2 has hexagonal crystal structure with space group of P63/mmc. The theoretical density of Ti3SiC2 is 4.53g/cm3 and the melting point exceeds 3000 °C. The measured Young’s modulus is 320 GPa and microhardness is 4 GPa (2). Despite the remarkable properties, synthesis of Ti3SiC2 is difficult. Jeitschko et al (3) synthesized pure Ti3SiC2 through chemical reaction between TiH2, Si and graphite, but the method is limited to laboratory scale by its efficiency. Recently, a number of methods including self-propagating high temperature synthesis (SHS) (4), arc-melting (5) and solid-state reaction (6) have been utilized to synthesize Ti3SiC2. In most of these methods carbides (e.g. TiC or SiC) and silicides (e.g. Ti5Si3, TiSi2) were co-existing with Ti3SiC2 in the product. Thus work is needed to develop new methods for the synthesis of Ti3SiC2. In this paper, a solid-liquid process for the formation of Ti3SiC2 powders was reported. The starting materials are Ti, Si and graphite powders, and the liquid phase was formed by the addition of fluorite, i.e., NaF. The Ti3SiC2 powders prepared using this process were characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The effect of synthesis temperature on the composition of the reaction products was investigated by quantitative X-ray analysis."
Crystallographic relations between Ti3SiC2 and TiC,Yanchun Zhou,Zhimei Sun,Yanchun Zhou,"Yanchun Zhou,Zhimei Sun",Materials Research Innovations,Q3,0.473,3,5,286-291,2000,MANEY PUBLISHING,https://doi.org/10.1007/PL00010876,2000inno-zhou_innovations_2000.pdf,2000inno-zhou_innovations_2000.jpg,"?Ti3SiC2 is a so-called not-so-brittle ceramic that combines the merits of both metals and ceramics. However, many previous works demonstrated that its bonding nature and properties were strongly related to TiC. In this paper the crystallographic relations between Ti3SiC2 and TiC were established and described based on the transmission electron microscopy investigation on the Ti3SiC2/TiC interface in Ti3SiC2 based material. At Ti3SiC2/TiC interface, the following crystallographic relationships were identified: (111)TiC//(001)Ti3SiC2, (002) TiC//(104)Ti3SiC2, and [11 ?0]TiC//[110]Ti3SiC2. Based on the above interfacial relations an interfacial structure model was established. The structure of Ti3SiC2 could be considered as two-dimensional closed packed layers of Si periodically intercalated into the (111) twin boundary of TiC0.67 (Ti3C2). The intercalation resulted in the transformation from cubic TiC0.67 to hexagonal Ti3SiC2. In the opposite case, de-intercalation of Si from Ti3SiC2 caused the transformation from hexagonal Ti3SiC2 to cubic TiC0.67. Understanding the crystallographic relations between Ti3SiC2 and TiC is of vital importance in both understanding the properties and optimizing the processing route for preparing pure Ti3SiC2."

The result demonstrated that the Ti3SiC2 ceramic consisted of mainly laminated grains. It was found, with the aid of computer simulated crystallite shape, that the laminated Ti3SiC2 grains were composed of thin hexagonal plates. These laminated grains characterized the Ti3SiC2, and were responsible for the mechanical properties of the polycrystalline Ti3SiC2 ceramic. The measured flexural strength and the fracture toughness were 470 ± 26 MPa and 7.0 ± 0.2 MPa·m1/2, respectively. The high toughness was attributed to the contribution of crack deflection, crack bridging, delaminating and grain pull-out of laminated Ti3SiC2."

The chemical bonding in Ti2AlC and Ti2AlN is also anisotropic and is metallic-covalent-ionic in nature. On the basis of total-energy estimation we conclude that the replacement of C by N will result in a stabilization of the hexagonal structure and decrease in metallic properties.

The SiC impurities were one-dimensional disordered, i.e. with overwhelming of stacking faults and could be distinguished from TiC. Beside the observed impurities imbedded in Ti3SiC2, an interesting phenomenon was that needle-shaped Ti3SiC2 was also observed within TiC grains. The needle-shape Ti3SiC2 grew in TiC following the crystallographic relations of (111) TiC // (0001) Ti3SiC2, (002) TiC // (11?04) Ti3SiC2, and [11?0] TiC // [110] Ti3SiC2.

The present results demonstrated that the scale growth on Ti3SiC2-base material obeyed a parabolic rate law up to 20 cycles. It then changed to a linear rate with further increasing cycles. The scales formed on the Ti3SiC2-base material were composed of an inward-growing, fine-grain mixture of TiO2+SiO2?and an outward-growing, coarse-grain TiO2. Theoretical calculations show that the mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients between the inner scale and Ti3SiC2-base matrix is small.

The stress–strain analysis of this deformation mode reveals Nb–Al bond breaking, while the Nb–C bond length decreases by 4.1%. Furthermore, there is no evidence for phase transformation during deformation. This is consistent with basal slip and may be understood on the basis of the electronic structure: bands below the Fermi level are responsible for the dd bonding between NbC basal planes and only a single band with a weak dd interaction is not resistant to shearing, while all other bands are unaffected. The Al–Nb bonding character can be described as mainly metallic with weak covalent–ionic contributions. Our study demonstrates that Al layers move with relative ease under shear strain. Phase conservation upon shearing is unusual for carbides and may be due to the layered nature of the phase studied. Here, we describe the electronic origin of basal slip in Nb2AlC, the atomic mechanism which enables reversible plasticity in this class of materials."

We propose that these phases can be classified into two groups based on the valence electron concentration induced changes in C44. One group comprises M=V B and VIB, where the C44?values are approximately 170?GPa and independent of the corresponding MC. The other group includes M=IIIB and IVB, where the C44?shows a linear dependency with the corresponding MC. This may be understood based on the electronic structure: shear resistant bands are filled in M2AlC phases with M=V B and VIB, while they are not completely filled when M=IIIB and IVB. This notion is also consistent with our stress–strain analysis. These valence electron concentration induced changes in shear behaviour were compared to previously published valence electron concentration induced changes in compression behaviour [Z. Sun, D. Music, R. Ahuja, S. Li, J.M. Schneider, Phys. Rev. B 70 (2004) 092102]. These classification proposals exhibit identical critical valence electron concentration values for the group boundary.

This type of data storage is achieved by the fast reversible phase transition between amorphous and crystalline GST upon heat pulse. Here we report pressure-induced reversible crystalline-amorphous and polymorphic amorphous transitions in NaCl structured GST by ab initio molecular dynamics calculations. We have showed that the onset amorphization of GST starts at approximately 18?GPa and the system become completely random at approximately 22?GPa. This amorphous state has a cubic framework (c-amorphous) of sixfold coordinations. With further increasing pressure, the c-amorphous transforms to a high-density amorphous structure with trigonal framework (t-amorphous) and an average coordination number of eight. The pressure-induced amorphization is investigated to be due to large displacements of Te atoms for which weak Te–Te bonds exist or vacancies are nearby. Upon decompressing to ambient conditions, the original cubic crystalline structure is restored for c-amorphous, whereas t-amorphous transforms to another amorphous phase that is similar to the melt-quenched amorphous GST."

The encoding is achieved by the large contrast in physical properties between the two states. Ge vacancies (V-Ge) and Sb antisite atoms (Sb-Te) are primary point defects in crystalline GST. The effect of V-Ge and Sb-Te on the atomic arrangements in amorphous GST is unknown, which, however, has significant effects on the performance of GST. In this work, by means of ab initio molecular dynamics calculations, the atomic arrangements in amorphous ideal and defective GST have been investigated. The results show that the amorphous structure of GST with Sb-Te (St-GST) or with V-Ge (V-GST) has the same cubic framework and close chemical ordering to ideal GST, and hence similar fast reversible phase transition behavior is expected in the defective phases. Furthermore, the presence of Sb-Te or V-Ge in the crystalline phase will result in much more Ge atoms in a tetrahedral geometry as well as in a fourfold octahedral environment in the amorphous state.

As fourfold octahedral Ge atoms can enhance the large contrast in physical properties between the crystalline and amorphous phases, introducing Ge vacancies would be an efficient way to improve the performance of GST phase-change materials."

The crystal structure of the title compound can be derived from breaking the cuprate planar layer to form isolated, nonplanar triangular copper trimers ({[Cu3(μ3-Cl)(OH)3](OH)6Cl2}6?), which are connected by strontium coordination spheres to form a novel framework structure. The copper trimers exhibit an unprecedented array that has triangular Cu3-planes perpendicular not only to their own layer but also to their counterparts in the next layers, which is thus different from the parallel array in the Kagomé layer of ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2.

The ferromagnetism, arising from the itinerant Cr d electrons, introduces intrinsic half-metallicity in Cr2C MXene, with the half-metallic gap as large as 2.85 eV. We also demonstrate a ferromagnetic–antiferromagnetic transition accompanied by a metal to insulator transition in Cr2C, caused by surface functionalization with F, OH, H, or Cl groups. Moreover, the energy gap of the antiferromagnetic insulating state is controllable by changing the type of functional groups.

Searching and designing appropriate materials used in the memories becomes an urgent task. Here, a structure with the TaO2 formula was predicted using evolutionary algorithms in combination with first-principles calculations. This triclinic structure (T-TaO2) is both energetically and dynamically more favorable than the commonly believed rutile structure (R-TaO2). The metal-insulator transition (MIT) between metallic R-TaO2 and T-TaO2 (band gap: 1.0?eV) is via a Peierls distortion, which makes TaO2 a potential candidate for RRAM. The energy barrier for the reversible phase transition is 0.19?eV/atom and 0.23?eV/atom, respectively, suggesting low power consumption for the resistance switch. The present findings about the MIT as the resistance-switch mechanism in Ta-O system will stimulate experimental work to fabricate tantalum oxides based RRAM."

We found that Ni2Zn11 remains energetically, mechanically and dynamically stable under the present studied pressure range. Further analysis on the electronic structure of Ni2Zn11 unravels that under various pressures, the pseudogap at the Fermi level which reduces the electronic energy of the system accounts for the stability of γ brasses, i.e., the well-known stabilization mechanism still holds at high pressure. Besides, various thermodynamic quantities of Ni2Zn11 under high pressure were systematically calculated and analyzed.

In this work, we unravel the above problems based on ab-initio calculations. Our results show that the alloyed Nb5Si3 systems become less stable as the alloying elements change from group IVB to VIB in the periodic table. The occupation preferences of the alloying elements depend on their relative atomic radii respect to either Nb or Si. Furthermore, the dissolution of the alloying elements is easier at high temperatures by the Debye model analysis, from which the homogenization-treatment temperatures of alloyed Nb5Si3 phases are also deduced. All alloyed Nb5Si3 phases are mechanically stable, even though their mechanical properties like ductility are not improved. Finally, the electron localized function, Bader charge and densities of states are used to understand the structure stability of alloyed Nb5Si3, and we find that ionic bonding has quite significant effects on the stability of these intermetallic compounds."

Based on first principles calculations and transition state theory, using SrZrO3 (SZO) as an example, we found that the diffusion energy of an oxygen vacancy strongly depends on its charge states and V2+O contributes mostly to the resistance switching due to its lowest activation energy. To adjust the performance of SZO RRAM, the effects of dopants (Y, V, Nb and Ta) were revealed according to their modifications on the diffusion of V2+O. We found that doping of Y or V has the most significant effect on the performance of RRAM devices. Furthermore, for dopants with various numbers of valence electrons and atomic radius, general design principles were proposed based on their different effects on the RRAM characteristics.

The bandgap of phosphorene experiences a direct-to- indirect transition when 5% shear strain is applied. The electronic origin of the direct-to-indirect gap transition from 1.54 eV at ambient conditions to 1.22 eV at 10% shear strain for phosphorene is explored.

In this study, we extensively investigated the stress–strain curves and the deformation mechanisms in response to tensile stress by first principles calculations using 2D Tin+1Cn (n = 1, 2 and/or 3) as examples. Our results show that 2D Ti2C can sustain large strains of 9.5%, 18% and 17% under tensions of biaxial and uniaxial along x and y, respectively, which respectively increase to 20%, 28% and 26.5% for 2D Ti2CO2 due to surface functionalizing oxygen, which is much better than graphene (15% biaxial). The failure of 2D Tin+1Cn MXene is due to the significant collapse of the surface atomic layer; however, surface functionalization could slow down this collapse, resulting in the improvement of mechanical flexibility. We have also discussed the critical strains and Young's modulus of 2D Tin+1Cn and Tin+1CnO2. Our results provide an insight into the microscopic deformation mechanism of MXenes and hence benefit their applications in flexible electronic devices."

The overall toughening effect of the alloying elements on multi-composites is dependent on the alloying effect on each component. However, the influence of Ti on the brittleness of a-Nb5Si3 is unclear, which makes the beneficial effect of Ti on the mechanical properties of Nb-Si-based alloy ambiguous.

The concentration-sensitive effect of alloying Ti is induced by the variation of its substitution site and can be well explained by the electronic structure analysis.

The resistive switching (RS) in Ta2O5-based RRAM is generally believed to be due to the diffusion of oxygen vacancy (Vo) inside the oxide, while the role of metal interstitials is paid less attention. Here, on the basis of first-principles calculations, we show that the role of interstitial Ta (Tai) is competitive under the oxygen-poor condition and should also contribute to RS in Ta2O5. This is obvious by our calculated comparable energy barriers for the diffusion of Vo and Tai, which are 3.5 and 3.7 eV, respectively. Furthermore, the presence of electric field in working devices will enhance the migration of Tai due to its higher charge states compared to Vo. Meanwhile, Tai will introduce more defect states closer to the conduction bands and, thus, is more effective on tuning the electronic structure of Ta2O5. The present work unravels the contribution of Ta cations in RS of tantalum oxidebased RRAM, presenting a synergistic RS mechanism of oxygen vacancies and metal interstitials, which should be helpful for optimizing and designing novel RRAM devices."

However, it is rather complex for the case of VO due to the existence of magnetic ordering. For VO, magnetic ordering behavior exists in the rock-salt and the predicted P1? structure according to the hybrid functional calculations. After relaxation, the magnetic ordering causes local distortion in the original rock-salt structure, leading to a R3?M symmetry, which becomes more stable than the predicted P1? structure. Furthermore, the ionic TM?O bonding of the predicted phases is rather weaker than that of their rock-salt counterparts. While the enhanced metal?metal bonding characterized by the distances between the nearest-neighboring metallic atoms is found to be responsible for the stabilization of the ground state structures discovered here. Our findings deepen the understanding of the ground state of early TM?MOs, which is vital for the unraveling of the complete physical picture for transition metal monoxides."

A tight-binding (TB) model based on the dz2-, dxy-, and dx2.y2-orbital basis in a triangular lattice is also constructed to describe the QSH states in Mo2MC2O2. It shows that the atomic spin.orbit coupling (SOC) strength of M totally contributes to the topological gap at the Γ point, a useful feature dvantageous over the usual cases where the topological gap is much smaller than the atomic SOC strength based on the classic Kane.Mele (KM) or Bernevig. Hughes.Zhang (BHZ) model. Consequently, Mo2MC2O2 show sizable gaps from 0.1 to 0.2 eV with different M atoms, sufficiently large for realizing room-temperature QSH effects. Another advantage of Mo2MC2O2 MXenes lies in their oxygencovered
surfaces which make them antioxidative and stable upon exposure to air."

In this article, the current progress in the strain engineering of graphene is reviewed. We first summarize the strain effects on the electronic structure and Raman spectra of graphene. We then highlight the lectron–phonon coupling greatly enhanced by the biaxial strain and the strong pseudomagnetic field induced by the non-uniform strain with specific distribution. Finally, the potential application of strain-engineering in the self-assembly of foreign atoms on the graphene surface is also discussed. Given the short history of graphene straintronics research, the current progress has been notable, and many further advances in this field are expected."

Hence, numerous studies have been carried out to search suitable dopants to improve the performance; however, the explored dopants always cause phase separation and thus drastically reduce the reliability of phase-change memory. In this work, on the basis of ab initio calculations, we have identified yttrium (Y) as an optimal dopant for Sb2Te3, which overcomes the phase separation problem and significantly increases the resistivity of crystalline state by at least double that of Sb2Te3. The good phase stability of crystalline Y-doped Sb2Te3 (YST) is attributed to the same crystal structure between Y2Te3 and Sb2Te3 as well as their tiny lattice mismatch of only ?1.1%. The significant increase in resistivity of c-YST is understood by our findings that Y can dramatically increase the carrier’s effective mass by regulating the band structure and can also reduce the intrinsic carrier density by suppressing the formation of SbTe antisite defects. Y doping can also improve the thermal stability of amorphous YST based on our ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, which is attributed to the stronger interactions between Y and Te than that of Sb and Te."

Here, we show how the catalytic performance of MoS2 monolayers can be improved dramatically by catalyst size reduction and surface sulfur (S) depletion. Monolayered MoS2 nanocrystals (NCs) (2–25 nm) produced via exfoliating and disintegrating their bulk counterparts showed improved catalysis rates over monolayer sheets because of their increased edge ratios and metallicity. Subsequent S depletion of these NCs further improved the metallicity and made Mo atoms on the basal plane become catalytically active. As a result, the S-depleted NCs with low mass (?1.2 μg) showed super high catalytic performance on HER with a low Tafel slope of ?29 mV/decade, overpotentials of 60–75 mV, and high current densities jx (where x is in mV) of j150 = 9.64 mA·cm–2 and j200 = 52.13 mA·cm–2. We have found that higher production rates of H2 could not be achieved by adding more NC layers since HER only happens on the topmost surface and the charge mobility decreases dramatically. These difficulties can be largely alleviated by creating a hybrid structure of NCs immobilized onto three-dimensional graphene to provide a very high surface exposure of the catalyst for electrochemical HER, resulting in very high current densities of j150 = 49.5 mA·cm–2 and j200 = 232 mA·cm–2 with ?14.3 μg of NCs. Our experimental and theoretical studies show how careful design and modification of nanoscale materials/structures can result in highly efficient catalysis. There may be considerable opportunities in the broader family of transition metal dichalcogenides beyond just MoS2 to develop highly efficient atomically thin catalysts. These could offer cheap and effective replacement of precious metal catalysts in clean energy production."

Our results highlight 2D Zr2CO2 and Hf2CO2 as
the candidate single photocatalysts for possible high efficiency photocatalytic water splitting. A significant property of 2D Zr2CO2 and Hf2CO2 is that they exhibit unexpectedly high and directionally
anisotropic carrier mobility, which may effectively facilitate the migration and separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Meanwhile, these two MXenes also exhibit very good optical
absorption performance in the wavelength ranging approximately from 300 to 500 nm. The stability of 2D Zr2CO2 and Hf2CO2 in liquid water is expected to be good based on ab initio molecular dynamics

the micro-mechanism of photocatalytic hydrogen production on MXenes. Our findings will open a new way to facilitate the discovery and application of MXenes for photocatalytic water splitting."

The alloying strengthening mechanism mediated by vacancy is also evaluated via calculating the Griffith work of fracture for g/g0 interface as well as the energy barrier of vacancy migration at the interface. The calculated results show that a Ni vacancy on (001)g0 plane does not change the most preferable substitution position of the alloying elements at corner-point Ni site on (001)g except Cr. These alloying elements in g0 enhance the interfacial bonding strength of g/g0 interface even with the presence of a neighboring vacancy, among which Re exhibits the best strengthening effect. The improvement in the g/g0 interfacial strength is ascribed to the increased chemical bonding strength between the alloying atom and the nearest-neighbor host atom. Furthermore, a single Ni vacancy has higher migration energy barriers around the alloying solutes especially Re solute substituting on (001)g at g/g0 interface, although the alloying solutes at these preferable sites have no contribution to the interfacial bonding strength."

Furthermore, the exfoliated (V1-xTix)2C MXene shows better multilayered morphology characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Meanwhile, by analyzing the exfoliation process and electron localization functions, we have demonstrated that the micro-origin of Ti enhancement effect on the exfoliation of (V1-xTix)2AlC is due to the significantly weakened interlayer bonding between the VC and Al layers in (V1-xTix)2AlC induced by alloying Ti. Finally, we have shown that the performance of (V1-xTix)2C as anode materials for Li-ion batteries is improved with the increase of Ti content.

Based on Rice-Wang Model, it is found that Y embrittles the GB; while Ti and Si strengthen it; the effect of Cr on the GB cohesion is structure-dependent. The strengthening/embrittling of the GBs induced by the segregation are attributed to the local structural distortion and charge redistributions around GBs. The underlying physical origin of different alloying effects on the intergranular fracture are identified to be the variation of bonding characters between the host NbeNb atoms across the GB regions."

Here we predict the monolayered indium? riphosphide (InP3) as a new semiconducting 2D material with a range of favorable functional properties by means of ab initio calculations. The 2D InP3 crystal shows high stability and promise of experimental synthesis. It possesses an indirect band gap of 1.14 eV and a high electron mobility of 1919 cm2 V?1 s?1, which can be strongly manipulated with applied strain. Remarkably, the InP3 monolayer suggests tunable magnetism and half-metallicity under hole doping or defect engineering, which is attributed to the novel Mexican-hat-like bands and van Hove singularities in its electronic structure. A semiconductor?metal transition is also revealed by doping 2D InP3 with electrons. Furthermore, monolayered InP3 exhibits extraordinary optical absorption with significant excitonic effects in the entire range of the visible light spectrum. All these desired properties render 2D InP3 a promising candidate for future applications in a wide variety of technologies, in particular for electronic, spintronic, and photovoltaic devices."
Reduction of thermal conductivity in YxSb2-xTe3 for phase change memory,Zhen Li,Naihua Miao,Jian Zhou,"Zhen Li,Naihua Miao,Jian Zhou,Huibin Xu,Zhimei Sun",Journal of Applied Physics,Q2,2.328,122,19,195107,2017,"AMER INST PHYSICS, 1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5004495,2017jap-lizhen.pdf,2017jap_lizhen.jpg,"Thermal conductivity (j) is one of the fundamental properties of materials for phase change memory (PCM) application, as the set/reset processes strongly depend upon heat dissipation and transport. The j of phase change materials in both amorphous and crystalline phases should be quite small, because it determines how energy-efficient the PCM device is during programming. At a high temperature, the electronic thermal conductivity (je) is always notable for semiconductors, which is still lacking for antimony telluride under doping in the literature as far as we know. In this paper, using density functional theory and Boltzmann transport equations, we report calculations of lattice thermal conductivity jL and electronic thermal conductivity je of the yttrium doped antimony telluride. We show that the average value of thermal conductivity decreases from? 2.5W m-1K-1 for Sb2Te3 to? 1.5W m-1K-1 for Y0.167Sb1.833Te3. This can be attributed to the reduced jL and je, especially the je at high temperature (near melting point). We further point out that the increased effective mass of carriers and the flat valance band edge are responsible for the decrease of je. The reduced thermal conductivity is highly desirable for the decrease of heat dissipation and transport in PCM operations, which can increase the density of memory and reduce energy consumption."

In this work, by means of?ab initio?calculations, we have systematically investigated the electronic structures, optical properties, and mechanical properties of MXene/Blue Phosphorene (BlueP) vdW heterostructures under various deformations. We highlight that, under strain, the type-I heterostructures can be transformed to type-II with their conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) separated in different layers. Interestingly, the locations of the CBM or VBM in MXene/BlueP vdW heterostructures can also be reversed by compressive or tensile strain between the building layers, which indicates that either layer can be utilized as an electron donor or acceptor by varying its deformation conditions. Meanwhile, this compressive (tensile) strain can also induce a red (blue) shift in the optical absorption spectra of MXene/BlueP vdW heterostructures. Finally, our results on the mechanical flexibility and deformation mechanism of MXene/BlueP vdW heterostructures suggest their great long-term stability as well as promising applications in flexible devices.

Insight into the role of oxygen in the phase-change material GeTe,Linggang Zhu,Zhen Li,Zhimei Sun,"Linggang Zhu, Zhen Li, Jian Zhou, Naihua Miao, Zhimei Sun",Journal of Materials Chemistry C,Q2,5.433,5,14,3592-3599,2017,"ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY, THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",https://doi.org/10.1039/C7TC00127D,2017-JMCC-zhulinggang,2017-JMCC-zhulinggang,"Oxygen is widely used to tune the performance of chalcogenide phase-change materials in the usage of phase-Change random access memory (PCRAM) which is considered as the most promising next-generation non-volatile memory. However, the microscopic role of oxygen in the write-erase process, i.e., the reversible phase transition between crystalline and amorphous state of phase-change materials is not clear yet. Using oxygen doped GeTe as an example, this work unravels the role of oxygen at the atomic scale by means of ab initio total energy calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Our main finding is that after the amorphization and the subsequent re-crystallization process simulated by ab initio molecular dynamics, oxygen will drag one Ge atom out of its lattice site and both atoms stay in the interstitial region near the Te vacancy that was originally occupied by the oxygen, forming a ""dumbbell-like"" defect (O-VTe-Ge), which is in sharp contrast to the results of ab initio total energy calculations at 0 K showing that the oxygen prefers to substitute Te in crystalline GeTe. This specific defect configuration is found to be responsible for the slower crystallization speed and hence the improved data retention of oxygen doped GeTe as reported in recent experimental work. Moreover, we find that the oxygen will increase the effective mass of the carrier and thus increases the resistivity of GeTe. Our results unravel the microscopic mechanism of the oxygen-doping optimization of phase-change material GeTe, and the present reported mechanism can be applied to other oxygen doped ternary chalcogenide phase-change materials."

Blue Phosphorene (BlueP) is a promising 2D semiconductor for electronic and optoelectronic applications. Here, we report that Zr-, Hf- and Nb-based 2D transition metal carbides (MXenes) are ideal electrode materials for BlueP based on extensive investigations of the electronic properties and interfacial Schottky barrier characteristics of BlueP/MXene heterojunctions by first-principles calculations. Our results show that the strong interaction between BlueP and bare MXenes destroys the semiconducting character of BlueP, and thus bare MXenes are not ideal contact electrodes. While with the surface functionalization of MXene, the intrinsic electronic feature of BlueP is well preserved in the BlueP/surface-engineered MXene heterojunctions. Furthermore, the interfacial Schottky barriers of the heterojunctions are affected by the terminal surface groups on MXenes and vanishing Schottky barriers are achieved in some MXenes with the formula Zrn+1CnF2, Hfn+1CnF2, Zrn+1Cn(OH)2, Hfn+1Cn(OH)2 and Nbn+1Cn(OH)2. Finally, we demonstrate that the work functions of MXenes and the interface dipole induced by charge rearrangement are two underlying factors to determine the magnitude of Schottky barriers. This work provides fundamentals for selecting ideal electrode material for BlueP and is also beneficial for optimizing electrodes for other 2D semiconductors."

In this work, an unexpected isotropic van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure is proposed, based on the assembly of two-dimensional crystals of anisotropic black phosphorene (BP) and transition metal carbide (TiC2). Using vdW-corrected density functional theory calculations, the BP/TiC2 vdW heterostructure was predicted to have excellent structural and mechanical stability, superior electrical conductivity, omnidirectional flexibility, and a high Li storage capacity. We have unraveled the physical origin of the excellent stability, as well as the Li adsorption preferences of the lithiated heterostructure, based on a three-step analysis of the stability of the Li-adsorption processes. In addition, the BP/TiC2 vdW heterostructure can also be applied as the anode material for flexible Na-ion batteries because of its high Na storage capacity and strong Na binding. However, compared with Na adsorption, the capacity is higher, and the adsorption energy is more negative for Li adsorption.

It is observed that hydrogen and oxygen atoms prefer to adsorb on the fcc and hcp (threefold hollow) sites, respectively.

The diffusion behavior is known to be highly sample-dependent, but the reasons for this are less well understood. Here, rutile is studied by using first-principles calculations, in order to unravel the microscopic origins of the diverse diffusion behaviors for different doping elements. Anomalous diffusion behavior in the open channel along the [001] direction is found: larger atoms including Sc and Zr have lower energy barrier for diffusion via interstitial mechanism, apparently contradicting their known slow diffusion rate. To resolve this, we present an alternate model for the overall diffusion rate of the large-size dopants in rutile, showing that parallel to the [001] channel, it is limited by the formation of the interstitial states, whereas in the direction perpendicular to [001], it proceeds via a kick-out mechanism. By contrast, Co and Ni prefer to stay in the interstitial site of rutile, and have conventional diffusion with a very small migration barrier in the [001] channel. This leads to highly anisotropic and fast diffusion. The diffusion mechanisms found in the present study can explain the diffusion data measured by experiments."

Calculated temperature-dependent formation energies indicate that all the L12-type Co3(Al, M) can be generated at high temperature and show better stability than their D019-type according to the quasi-harmonic Debye model. Furthermore, we reveal that the element Al plays a major role in promoting L12 structure more stable than D019 structure for the Co3(Al, W), and the element W reduces metastability as well as improves the strength of L12. We also find that most of the L12-Co3(Al, M) compounds possess good mechanical stability and ductility, which are verified by the elastic constants and Poisson’s ratio. More importantly, the element Cr can be used to replace the W of L12-Co3(Al, W) to increase the strength to weight ratio as the L12-Co3(Al, Cr) possesses comparable elastic properties to the L12-Co3(Al, W), including the Young’s and shear moduli. It is also observed that all the L12-Co3(Al, M) compounds show a high degree of elastic anisotropy. The electron localized function and suggests that the rise of the Young’s moduli in Co3(Al, M), with the alloying element M changing from group IVB to VIB, is mainly attributed by the increasing bonding strength of the nearby transition-metal atoms. Our results will be useful for the study of thermodynamic and mechanical properties as well as the design of Co-based high-temperature alloys."

The DSC with Fe-doped NiS2 octahedrons CE demonstrates a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.01%, higher than those of NiS2 CE (6.90%) and FeS2 CE (4.13%).

For 1 QL, Seebeck coefficient has been greatly enhanced due to the increase in the number of band extrema by virtue of the twelvefold valley degeneracy from surface states. For 4 QLs, the high ZT value is attributed to the much longer surface relaxation time associated with the robust nature of the topological surface states. Moreover, the ZT values and the TI character of few-quintuple Sb2Te3 nanofilms demonstrate thickness(layer)-dependent behaviors. Our results offer significant clues for future applications and investigations of Sb2Te3-related quintuple layers as promising p-type thermoelectric materials and quasi-2D topological insulators for nanoelectronics."

Our results indicate that the functionalization of O significantly decreases both the lattice and electron thermal conductivities of Ti2C MXenes because O will induce not only a shorter phonon relaxation time but also a metal–semiconductor transition, showing great potential for applications including thermoelectrics. In contrast to O, after being functionalized by F or OH both the lattice and electron thermal conductivities are increased, which will improve heat dissipation in electronics and batteries. Our findings will provide a fundamental guideline to the design of MXene-based devices with optimal thermal transport performance."

Further, the melting-quenching process induced amorphous-crystalline phase-change needs high energy consumption. In this work, reversible resistance switching is observed in crystalline Ge1Sb4Te7 ribbons driven by voltage polarity, without amorphous-crystalline phase-change. Consequently, the large density variation and the high energy consumption are avoided, which overcomes those two restrictions of PCM. Moreover, on the basis of ab initio calculations, the underlying mechanism is further analyzed and it is concluded that this switching is induced by the reversible swapping of antimony between its lattice site and the center of the Te-Te van der Waals bilayers."

However, the specific influence of vacancies on the performance of MXene-based LIBs and the corresponding mechanism still remain open issues. Herein, we highlighted that compared with other well-studied 2D materials (such as graphene, 2D MoS2), MXene are more likely to contain vacancies with defect formation energies as low as 0.96 eV. The difference of vacancy formation energy for MXenes mainly originates from the variation of M-X bonding strengths. Furthermore, the vacancy defect will enhance the adsorption of Li in the region near the defect through acting as a potential trap, which may cause the first cycle irreversibility for lithiation/delithiation process in Mo2C MXene LIBs. Nevertheless, Li tends to migrate on defect-free surface of Mo2C MXene with energy barrier of 0.096-0.115 eV and thus this potential trap has a minor influence on the charge-discharge rate of Mo2C MXene LIBs. We believe that our findings provide not only some insights into the recent experimental results but also guidance for the preparation and practical application of MXene in LIBs."

In this work, the influence of graphene on the Au/HfO2 interface is studied using a first-principles calculation. It is found that graphene can eliminate the Au-induced insulator-metal-transition of the HfO2 layer at the interface, by screening the strong interaction between Au and HfO2. At the atomic scale, graphene significantly increases the formation energy of the oxygen vacancy and vacancy pair in HfO2 at the Au/HfO2 interface, making the interfacial HfO2-layer surface-like. Also graphene alleviates the valence-electron-number dependent segregation of the alloying elements Ag, Cu and Ta at the Au/HfO2 interface.

Further reductions are made by the introduction of a solute-vacancy complex defect (similar to 80 mJ/m(2)). Furthermore, the unstable planar fault energies tuned by the Mo-Va and W-Va complex defects are almost identical, which are both slightly smaller than those by Re-Va. Finally, the calculated values of three twinnability measures elucidate that W and Mo provide similar enhancements in the twinning propensity of gamma-Ni to that by Re.

Using Sc as an example the doping effect on the structure and property of Sb2Te3 has been extensively investigated. The band gap of Sb2Te3 linearly increases with increasing the Sc concentration by ab initio calculations, and our experimental results confirm the theoretical findings. Furthermore, based on the semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory, Sc can significantly decrease the electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity of Sb2Te3, and therefore reduced energy consumption of Sb2Te3-based PCM is expected. Finally, the ab initio molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that Scandium can significantly improve the thermal stability of amorphous Sc-doped Sb2Te3, and hence the enhanced data reliability of Sb2Te3-based PCM.

We show that the increasing temperatures between 1000 K and 1400 K cause evident reductions in the bulk moduli and planar fault energies of Ni-Mo alloys. Furthermore, their negative slopes versus temperature are gradually diminished with increasing Mo concentration except that of the unstable stacking fault energy. Adopting recent theoretical models for twinning based on GSFE, increasing temperature enhances the twinnability of low-Mo alloys but has limited influences in the case of high-Mo alloys.

We highlighted that for the bcc phase at 0K, local ordering enhances configuration stability, while it has little influence on the elastic Young's modulus and shear modulus due to severe lattice distortion and elastic distortion in fully disordered configuration. Interestingly, with the increase of temperature, the structural stability and bulk modulus of the partially disordered configuration turns out to be higher than the fully disordered configuration, likely owing to the presence of strong chemical bonding between Al and X(Co, Cr, Fe, Ni).

With the rapid development of flexible electronics, it is highly desirable to search or design high-performance QSH insulators with excellent flexibility and large bandgap, which is still a huge challenge. Here, using first-principles calculations, we report that surface oxygen functionalization can transform two-dimensional (2D) GaSe monolayer from a trivial insulator to a nontrivial topological insulator with superior stretchability. The fully O-functionalized GaSe monolayer, GaSeO, exhibits a sizable QSH gap of 178 meV, in which the topological nature is characterized by the nontrivial Z(2) topological invariant and the topological edge states. The nontrivial band topology originates from the s-p band inversion in the crystal field. Remarkably, the GaSeO monolayer shows isotropic mechanical flexibility and can sustain large strains of up to 26%, beyond graphene and 2D flexible Ti2C. Furthermore, the QSH state of GaSeO is robust against small elastic strains. The discovery of this 2D flexible and large-gap QSH insulator opens up new opportunities for developing stretchable and low-power electronic devices. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Moreover, the intensity of e-p scattering is close to that of p-p scattering at 300 K in sharp contrast to normal cases. This abnormal e-p scattering is understood by a specific feature that the energy difference between occupied and empty electron states near the Fermi level is in the order of the characteristic phonon energy. By calculating the phonon transport property of 2D Nb2C, we show that this strong e-p scattering can result in great reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity.Our work also highlights a new way for searching novel 2D materials with low lattice thermal conductivity."

Yet the C configuration in polycrystalline GST and its microscopic role is unclear. Using the well-studied GeSb2Te4 as an example, this work unravels the microscopic C doping role based on ab initio calculations. Our results reveal that carbon prefers occupying the interstitials at very low C concentrations, while with a roughly critical C concentration of over 2%, carbon atoms will cluster at the grain boundaries, with very few carbon atoms might exist at the interstitials. With further increasing the C concentrations, C atoms tend to form ring-like configurations in the grain boundaries rather than chain-like configurations. This is due to that the covalent bonds in ring-like configurations are stronger than that in chain-like configurations. Further analysis on the lone-pair electrons and electronic densities of states show that C dopants significantly change the number of lone-pair electrons of surrounding atoms, thus affecting the electronic structure. Finally, the diffusion coefficient of C is estimated to be of the order of 10(-13)m(2)/s at 400 K, indicating the good stability of C dopants in GeSb2Te4. Our work provides fundamental understanding on the microscopic role of C doping in GST phase-change materials and benefits for improving the properties of the recording materials by controlling the doping concentration."

In the present work, tuning the energetic and kinetics of hydrogen at the Sigma 5(210)[001] GB of Ni by the alloying elements are studied using a comprehensive calculation. Firstly, the metallic elements that tend to stay at the GB are screened from 12 normally used alloying elements. It is found that as the size of the alloying element increases to 30% larger than Ni, its segregation tendency at the GB increases dramatically. The GB-segregated elements reconstruct the energy-landscape of the GB for hydrogen, significantly affecting the segregation and diffusion of hydrogen. Based on the calculations of the attempt frequency and energy barrier, we find that at room temperature the jump rate of hydrogen for the rate-determining step in the long-distance diffusion can be decreased by 5-10 orders (direction dependent), as Al, Ta, W or Zr is alloyed. Meanwhile, the pathway of the rate-limiting jump of H can be diverted in the presence of the alloying element. Thus the alloyed GB can act as an obstacle for the diffusion of hydrogen rather than a fast diffusion channel as in the case of a clean GB. The theoretical results are compared to the available experimental data. The present work provides valuable guidelines for improving the HE resistance of Ni alloys via grain boundary engineering.

We reveal that the successful achievements of the SB-free hole contacts at these MoS2/MXene interfaces depend on not only the high work functions of the MXenes but also the absence of the formation of interfacial gap states that usually result in strong Fermi level pinning in the midgap of a semiconductor. We further propose that efficient charge injection into MoS2 facilitated by SB-free contact could also increase the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of the 2H-MoS2 basal plane by improving its conductivity as well as its ability to adsorb hydrogen.

The high power factor of a p-type BST single QL originates from the robust multi-valley character of valence bands. The wide composition range is ensured by the valence band maximum dominated by the antibonding states of Sb-Te2 bonds, which would be affected little by the disorder. The optimal composition for the BST single QL is attributed to the different contributions from Sb and Bi to the valence band edge.

The evolution of interface sliding process reveals that all the initial shearings are nucleated at the regions of dislocations and their nodes. The interface with small lattice misfit could accommodate the shear strain via the dislocation loops gliding into neighboring massive coherent regions, exhibiting a comparatively low shear strength. However, at the interface with dense dislocation network, the adjacent gliding dislocation loops interact with each other and prohibit further interface sliding. Considering the gamma surfaces of three {111} interfaces, it is found that the miscellaneous bonding scheme across the interface can vary the preferred sliding directions and prevent the necessary transformation of the incipient sliding directions, which eventually increase the shear resistance. The shear strength of the Ni/Al {111} interface is increased by six times after alloying, verifying the co-operative strengthening effect contributed by the dense interfacial dislocations and miscellaneous bonding scheme.

In particular, it is easy for MXenes to form composites with other materials such as polymers, oxides, and carbon nanotubes, which further provides an effective way to tune the properties of MXenes for various applications. Not only have MXenes and MXene-based composites come into prominence as electrode materials in the energy storage field as is widely known, but they have also shown great potential in environment-related applications including electro/photocatalytic water splitting, photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide, water purification and sensors, thanks to their high conductivity, reducibility and biocompatibility. In this review, we summarize the synthesis and properties of MXenes and MXene-based composites and highlight their recent advances in environment-related applications. Challenges and perspectives for future research are also outlined."

However, by first-principles calculations, we have observed unusual lattice shrinkage when W replaces Ge in rock salt GeTe. We attribute this anomalous contract to the larger electronegativity difference between W and Te than between Ge and Te, which results in shorter W-Te bonds and pronounced local distortion around W dopants. The present work would provide new insight into the lattice parameter determination and a deeper understanding of the structural properties of ternary solid solutions."

Under large misfit dislocation spacing induced by huge lattice mismatch, misfit dislocation will dissociate independently with little influence of SFE. Meanwhile, the formation of a twin structure via dislocation climbing and the generation of Kink structure is found. When the dislocation spacing is sufficiently small, the supposed dissociated defect structure based on the geometric analysis becomes energetically unfavorable due to the high SFE, and distinct dissociation processes of the misfit dislocations occur: the dissociation of the dislocations at certain nucleate sites is hindered; the misfit dislocation decomposes towards bilateral phases rather than to only one of the constitute phase; the dissociation direction is reversed. Our work presents a novel understanding on the plastic-deformation mechanisms of semi-coherent interfaces and provides several feasible solutions to tune defect structures for material strengthening by introducing constitute phases with high SFE, controlling misfit parameters and applying different loading schemes."

Here, by performing an unbiased structural search and first-principles calculations, the electrocatalytic performance of the emerging 2D transitional-metal carbides, MC2 (M represents the transition metal of Ti, V, Nb, Ta, and Mo, C is carbon), is systematically investigated. Owing to their super stability and outstanding electronic conductivity, fast charge transfer kinetics is allowed during catalysis. Specifically, NbC2, TaC2, and MoC2 possess excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance under the reaction by the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. Moreover, taking advantage of the dual-active-site catalytic mechanism for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and ORR over traditional single-active-site mechanism, TaC2 presents promising bifunctional electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential of 0.06 and 0.37 V for HER and ORR, respectively. Meanwhile, the low overpotential endows MoC2 remarkable multifunctional electrocatalytic performance in overall water splitting (0.001 V for HER, 0.45 V for OER) and ORR (0.47 V). These intriguing results demonstrate the robust applicability of MC2 monolayers as effective electrocatalysts."

To further improve the performance of Sb2Te, various dopants such as scandium (Sc) have been explored. Yet, the thermal conductivity of the pristine and doped Sb2Te is unknown, even though the thermal conductivity (kappa) is an essential parameter for phase change memory devices as thermal conductivity determines the exchange of energy with surroundings and heat transport in the SET/RESET process. In this work, by means of ab initio calculations, we have calculated the thermal conductivity of Sb2Te, scandium (Sc)-doped and yttrium (Y)-doped Sb2Te. The calculated lattice thermal conductivity values at 300 K are 3.76 Wm(-1)K(-1), 3.22 Wm(-1)K(-1) and 3.35 Wm(-1)K(-1) for pristine Sb2Te, Sc-doped Sb2Te, and Y-doped Sb2Te, respectively, showing a reduction in lattice thermal conductivity by doping. Further analysis of the electron localization function and Bader charge distribution suggest that the increased bonding strength of the dopants with the surrounding atoms contributes to the reduction in lattice thermal conductivity of the doped Sb2Te. On the other hand, the electronic thermal conductivity of Sb2Te should also decrease due to the metal to semiconductor transition by Sc/Y doping as analyzed by the calculated density of states. Overall, the thermal conductivity of Sb2Te decreases to some extent by doping Sc and Y, which can lower the energy consumption and improve the efficiency of energy utilization in the data SET/RESET process and is thus desirable for phase-change memory devices.

This YST PCM, even being integrated into a conventional T-shaped device, exhibits an ultralow reset power consumption of 1.3 pJ and a competitive fast set speed of 6 ns.

This work highlights a novel way to obtain new PCMs with lower power consumption and competitive fast speed toward a universal memory."

Doping with Y or Sc has been exploited to optimize the performance of Sb?Te?, yet the substituted Y atoms are strongly clustered, while Sc is extremely expensive and thus is unfavourable for commercialization. In this work, we have successfully obtained better-performance and moderate-cost phase-change materials by co-doping Sc and Y based on ab initio calculations and ab initio molecular-dynamics simulations (AIMD). Sc can shrink the lattice while Y expands the lattice, which makes a perfect match between original and co-doped configurations and hence can benefit by maximizing the release of lattice strain. The co-doping increases the band gap to around 0.5 eV, and the concentration ratio of Sc and Y dopants provides an advantageous tool for controlling the electronic structure. Results of calculations using the BoltzTraP code show that co-doping can result in a significant reduction in the electrical conductivity at room temperature. AIMD simulation of amorphous co-doped Sb?Te? shows that the incorporation of Sc and Y atoms can effectively improve the thermal stability of amorphous Sb?Te?.

The ‘effective’ bonding that determines the energy of the system and the Ef will be clarified. The phase-change memory material GeTe is used as a case study. Firstly, 791 Ge-vacancy containing GeTe structures are studied and a large data set of the formation energy of the Ge-vacancy is obtained, which is helpful to understand the vacancy-induced issue of the amorphous GeTe including the resistance drift, etc. By using the ANN fitting based on the large energy data set, a bonding picture that is applicable to both the crystalline and the amorphous state of GeTe is predicted. In terms of the contribution to the formation energy of the vacancy, the weight ratio of the bond with length of 3.0–3.6 ? and 3.6–4.5 ? can be approximated as 6:1. The bonding information is further confirmed by using the first-principles electronic structure analysis on the randomly chosen samples. The bonding analysis using the ANN method based on a large vacancy-formation-energy data set is demonstrated to be a novel alternative technique to understand the bonding in the material. The proposed framework can be applied to a wide range of materials."

The in?uence of the local lattice distortion (LLD) on the SFE is explored.

D(111) slip decreases. The lattice distortion contributes signi?cantly to the ISFE but has limited in?uence on the USFE, leading to decline of the slip energy barriers of both alloys. The ISFE and slip energy barrier differences between the two alloys are enhanced by the lattice distortion. Based on the calculated ISFE and slip energy barrier, the effects of Al alloying and lattice distortion on the mechanical properties of CoCrNiFe HEA are discussed."

report realization of SMT in MoS2?xOx bilayers, driven by the concentration gradient of the chalcogen atom across the van der Waals (vdW) gap of the disordered bilayers. Using the cluster expansion method, we determined that either semiconducting (stable) or metallic states (metastable) can be realized in MoS2?xOx bilayers with the same composition. Machine learning analysis revealed that the concentration gradient of the chalcogen atom across the vdW gap is the leading ?ngerprint of SMT, with structural distortion induced by atom mixing being a signi?cant secondary factor. The electronic origin of the SMT is the broadening of the Mo dz2 and O pz bands, accompanied by the redistribution of the d electrons. This in-vdW-gap composition-gradient-driven SMT phenomenon also applies to MoSe2?xOx and MoTe2?xOx bilayers. The present work provides an alternative mechanism of SMT and demonstrates that the composition gradient across the vdW gap in the bilayer materials can be another degree of freedom to tune the band gaps without introducing extrinsic elements.

Here, we present an open-source computational platform named as ALKEMIE, acronyms for Artificial Learning and Knowledge Enhanced Materials Informatics Engineering, which enables easy access of data-driven techniques to broad communities. ALKEMIE is incorporated with three key components for the computational design of materials for the forthcoming data-driven sciences: data generation via high-throughput calculations, data management and data mining via machine learning models.

In terms of thermodynamics, the highest reaction Gibbs free-energy is 0.52 eV, 0.86 eV and 0.63 eV for the basal planes of 1T-Mo2C and 2H-Mo2C and the (100) edge plane of MoC2, respectively. Bader charge analysis indicates that the exposed Mo atoms bonded to NxHy (x = 1 and 2; 0 < y < 5) groups are the main contributors to the electron transfer from the catalysts to the NxHy groups, leading to the high NRR catalytic activity. Therefore, it is suggested that materials with exposed transition-metal atoms or single transition-metal atom catalysts may both serve as excellent NRR electrocatalysts.
